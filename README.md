# Brass Brushing Brilliance Landing Page
This is the landing page for my side-hustle, *Brass Brushing Brilliance*. It is a company that does brass instrument cleanings and basic repairs at an affordable price.

## How are you able to keep prices so low?
We shine in charging **less** for *basic* tasks. Baths, polishings, detarnishings, and slide alignings could easily be done by anyone, but they are *menial* and *tiresome* to do. Professional shops have large teams of fulltime workers and expensive equipment that they need to pay off, **we do not**. That difference keeps our work so inexpensive.
